* river-hs
river-hs is a wrapper over ~riverctl~ which allows you to create custom riverWM configurations in Haskell!

** How to use
 It is extremely easy to use river-hs, just git clone the project into your ~~/.config/river~ and modify ~app/Main.hs~
 to your liking! Once you're done, ~cabal build~ the project and copy over the binary into the root directory.
